# pulse ecosystem

a modeling system of reality by a behavioural point of view (it assumes intent but don't worry about micro interactions such as quemistryor physics), every creature live by a time frequency (pulse)

It allows implementation of (N-dimensional) realities containing creatures that can interact and live on it.

If simplifications such as time and behaviours have worked well for physics and psychology for so long it can work to model simple life =)

Reality itself holds no bounds against visibility or bending, creatures are the limited parts

Only up to one task can be finished per tick, so ticks should be at least frequent as the smallest task duration
